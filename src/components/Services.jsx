            <p className="text-justify text-xs">
              Temporary or contract staffing comes into picture when companies
              prefer to hire professional employees for short project-based
              work. In the changing industrial environments, it is not always
              possible to hire fulltime employees to meet the organization's
              work demands. Hence, hiring niche professionals on a temporary
              basis stands as the solution to reduce the workload on the
              existing employees

            <p className="text-justify text-xs">
              For the past two decades, the Information Technology industry
              underwent a tremendous evolution and has simultaneously brought
              about varied challenges for companies of all backgrounds. Of
              which, primary concerns are for the IT recruitment sectors. The
              development of a plethora of technology niches and a shortage of
              appropriately skilled employees is what bothers the organizations
              across the globe

            <p className="text-justify text-xs">
              Recruitment Process Outsourcing or RPO is the concept of handing
              over, entirely or a part of an organization's HR management
              responsibilities to an external staffing agency. The purpose of
              using an RPO service is to reduce the burden of recruiting new
              candidates and managing other HR related activities so that the
              companies can focus more on other tedious aspects of their
              businesses. RPO is a prominent solution to help you reduce
              unwanted wastage of time, money, and resources

              Hiring employees for a startup is significantly different from a
              large enterprise or business. When it comes to startups, starting
              from your search for eligible and talented candidates to
              processing formal interviews, all the activities requires a unique
              approach. The fact that your brand is not yet popular will demand
              your salary margins and workload to stay at meagre levels, and
              this can be considered as a primary reason why your startup needs
              special recruitment

              Payroll management is an extremely hectic and complicated task for
              all enterprises. While controlling all your other business
              activities may be put on one side, handling payroll and ensuring
              that it complies with the nation's statutes is another immense
              responsibility on its own. Organizations which prefer to do
              payroll management by themselves always complain of it, being
              time-consuming, expensive, and tricky. Hence, to be on the
              brighter side
